# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview

This repository contains an introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) framework. For this project, I will use the Mixtral8x7b open source Large Language Model (LLM) and see how to  "augment" its knowledge using user-specific (private) data. This project is divided into three parts:

1. RAG101: This is a beginners level introduction to RAG with LangChain. You will learn how to:
    * Load open source models using the Huggingface API in Langchain.
    * Prompt your loaded models.
    * Augment the LLM's knowledge with private data in a naive "way".
